/**
 * Every state-year, run through the calculator.
 *
 * calculator.test.ts asserts exact dollar figures, but only against the four
 * states whose data exercises an unusual code path (Alabama's occupational
 * tax, Colorado's OPT, Oregon's Arts Tax and transit tax, West Virginia).
 * That leaves 47 states whose brackets have never had a number checked, and
 * line coverage cannot see the gap: the untested states run the same lines as
 * the tested ones, just with different numbers in them.
 *
 * This sweep closes that. It deliberately does not assert correctness -- doing
 * that for 204 state-years would mean restating the tax code in the test, and
 * the restatement would be as likely to be wrong as the data. It asserts
 * plausibility instead, which is enough to catch what a bad data edit actually
 * produces: a bracket that throws, a NaN percentage, a negative bill, money
 * that appears or vanishes between the tax total and take-home, or a rate
 * nowhere near reality.
 *
 * Correctness of individual figures is a sourcing question, tracked per state
 * in src/data/<year>/SOURCING-STATUS.md.
