/**
 * Heuristics for wrong *values* in tax data -- the class `validate-tax-data`

 *
 * Every check here was chosen by testing candidate rules against a commit where
 * six states were known to be wrong, and keeping the ones that actually fired.
 * A cross-year equality check ("this year equals the next") was tried first and
 * rejected: it flagged 61 series to catch one real bug, and structurally could

 * neighbouring year is *also* wrong -- weakest exactly when the data is worst --
 * and it cannot see a value copied from a different field at all.
 *
 * These are WARNINGS. A legislature really can cut a standard deduction, and the
 * first time one does, a check that fails the build would block CI over correct
 * data. Read the hits, confirm each against the state's own publication, and
