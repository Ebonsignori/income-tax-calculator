  // Verified 2026-09-08 against SC Information Letter #26-4 (Revised),
  // 2026-01-30: OBBBA passed after the 2025 session adjourned, "South
  // Carolina has not had an opportunity to consider these federal changes",
  // and taxpayers must adjust their return for the standard deduction, which
  // OBBBA "increased by $750 for Single and Married Filing Separately, $1,125
  // for Head of Household, and $1,500 for Married Filing Jointly".

  // CORRECTED 2026-09-08: was 0 / 3,460 / 17,330 at a 6.2% top rate, which is
  // TY2024's schedule. Both boundaries and the rate were wrong.
  //
  // Boundaries $3,560 and $17,830 are printed outright in WH-1603F (2025),
  // rev. 11/12/24. That document's *rate* is stale -- it says 6.2%, because
  // it went out before the reduction to 6% took effect -- so the rate comes
  // from SCDOR's own rate history instead: "0 to a top rate of 6% for tax
  // year 2025".
  //
  // Reconciliation: SC1040TT_2025, the 1,070-row official tax table, is
  // reproduced exactly, every row, by 3,560/17,830 at 6.0%. The withholding
  // document's 6.2% misses 821 rows and the figures previously stored here
  // missed 1,000 of 1,070. At $21,000 of taxable income the table says $615;
  // this schedule gives $615.30 and the old one gave $640.54.
