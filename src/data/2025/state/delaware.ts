  // December 31, 1999, the standard deduction of a resident individual shall be
  // $3,250, and the standard deduction of resident spouses shall be $6,500 if
  // they file a joint return and $3,250 each if they file separate returns."
  // Delaware has no separate head-of-household amount; filing status 5 (head of
  // household) takes the $3,250 resident-individual figure, which the PIT-RES
  // instructions confirm line by line. Correct as stored, all four statuses.

  // VERIFIED 2026-09-08 against 30 Del. C. sec. 1102(a)(14), the schedule in
  // force since tax year 2014 and unamended since: 2.2% over $2,000, 3.9% over
  // $5,000, 4.8% over $10,000, 5.2% over $20,000, 5.55% over $25,000 and 6.6%
  // over $60,000, with the first $2,000 untaxed. The statute states one
  // schedule and draws no distinction by filing status, which is why every
  // status shares it.
  // Cross-checked arithmetically against the Division of Revenue's own
  // cumulative column, which reconciles only with these boundaries:
  //   3,000 x 2.2%  = $66.00    -> $66      at the $5,000 floor
  //   5,000 x 3.9%  = $195.00   -> $261     at the $10,000 floor
  //  10,000 x 4.8%  = $480.00   -> $741     at the $20,000 floor
  //   5,000 x 5.2%  = $260.00   -> $1,001   at the $25,000 floor
  //  35,000 x 5.55% = $1,942.50 -> $2,943.50 at the $60,000 floor
  // and $2,943.50 is exactly what the state income tax schedule printed at the
  // end of the tax table prints for $60,000 before the 6.60% top rate.
