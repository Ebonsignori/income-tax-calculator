  // DC decoupled from the federal standard deduction for tax years

  // Source: OTR 2025 D-40 booklet, "DC Basic Standard Deduction".
  // VERIFIED 2026-09-08. The booklet's "New for 2025 Income Tax Returns" says
  // "The District has established its own basic standard deduction amounts. For
  // tax year 2025, those amounts are: $15,000 for single filers, dependent

  // $22,500 for head of household filers; and $30,000 for married/registered
  // domestic partners filing jointly and qualifying widow(er) with dependent

  // figures ($15,750 / $31,500 / $23,625).

  // VERIFIED 2026-09-08 -- rate and (absence of) cap are both right, but see
  // the incidence warning below.
  //
  // Rate: 0.75%. D.C. Code sec. 32-541.03(a) states it outright, and the Office
  // of Paid Family Leave's published quarterly rate table carries 0.75% for
  // every quarter of 2025 and 2026. It rose from 0.26% on 2024-07-01 (D.C. Act
  // 25-499), so 2023 sat at 0.26% all year and 2024 was split 0.26/0.26/0.75/
  // 0.75 by quarter -- which is why neither of those files carries this tax.
  //
  // Cap: none. The statute charges the rate against "the wages of each of its
  // covered employees" with no wage base, so max INFINITY is correct here --
  // unlike Hawaii's TDI in this same audit, this one really is uncapped.
  //
  // *** FLAGGED: THE EMPLOYEE DOES NOT PAY THIS. *** sec. 32-541.03(a) reads
  // "A covered employer shall contribute an amount equal to 0.75% of the wages
  // of each of its covered employees to the District", and the programme's own
  // site says DC Paid Family Leave "is only available to private-sector
  // employees whose employer pays the PFL tax". Nothing is withheld from the
  // worker. This is the Newark payroll-tax defect from the 2026-09-07 audit,
  // in a second place: charging it costs a DC filer $750/yr at $100,000.
  // The fix is to list DC_PAID_FAMILY_LEAVE in NON_WAGE_TAX_TYPES
  // (src/constants/tax_types.ts) so the tax tables still document it and the
  // calculator stops charging it. That file is outside this task's ownership,
  // so the change has been reported rather than made -- do not "fix" this by
  // deleting the entry, which would lose a real DC programme from the tables.
