  //
  // Worth stating because it is not obvious: Arizona DOES carry the OBBBA
  // increase for 2025, unlike South Carolina, whose conformity date froze it
  // at the pre-OBBBA $15,000 / $30,000 / $22,500. Reading A.R.S. 43-1041(H)
  // alone suggests otherwise -- it indexes a 2019 base "in the same manner"
  // as the federal deduction, which sounds like inflation only -- but ADOR's
  // published figures match the post-OBBBA federal amounts exactly. The
  // department's own booklet is what settles it, not the statute.
