  // UNMODELLED / KNOWN OVERSTATEMENT, all years: Utah has no standard deduction, so this
  // file correctly has no STANDARD_DEDUCTION key -- but it also does not model
  // the nonrefundable taxpayer tax credit (Utah Code 59-10-1018) that stands
  // in place of one. The credit is 6% of the federal standard or itemized
  // deduction plus exemptions, reduced by 1.3% of income above a base amount
  // ($17,652 single / $35,304 joint / $26,478 head of household for 2025).
  // It cannot be written as a deduction band without inventing a rule, since
  // it phases out against a different figure than it is computed from.
  // At the 2025 single figures it is worth $945 at low income, $524 at
  // $50,000, and exactly $0 from about $90,300 up -- so the calculator is
  // right for higher earners and overstates tax below that.
