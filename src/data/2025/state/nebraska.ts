  // Corrected 2026-09-07: every boundary in all four schedules was wrong, and
  // wrong in two different ways, both wearing an off-by-one.
  // Single and separate held 2023's boundaries (3700 / 22170 / 35730) written
  // one dollar low as an inclusive max; joint was that doubled the same way.
  // Head of household held the un-indexed statutory base from Neb. Rev. Stat.
  // 77-2715.03(2)(a) (5,600 / 28,800 / 43,000), also one dollar low - which is
  // why it read as a $1 fall from 2024 rather than as a wrong year.
  // Note the repo's convention: one bracket's max IS the next one's min, so a
  // boundary is never written as the statute's inclusive "$0-5,599".
  // Reconciliation: the 2025 Nebraska Tax Table's over-the-top worksheet puts
  // the tax at $77,760 at $3,566 single / $3,088 joint / $3,276 head of
  // household. The old brackets returned $3,604.26, $3,164.97 and $3,471.05.
  // These reproduce all four to the dollar. Rates were already right.
  // Boundaries are the indexed figures from DOR's "History of Individual
  // Income Tax Rates by Brackets"; rates from Neb. Rev. Stat. 77-2715.03,
  // which fixes rate three and rate four year by year.
