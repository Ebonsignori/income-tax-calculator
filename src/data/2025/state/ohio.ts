  // Verified 2026-09-07: rates and boundaries correct. HB 96 cut the top rate

  // Source: ORC 5747.02(A)(3)(b), "For taxable years beginning in 2025".
  // https://codes.ohio.gov/ohio-revised-code/section-5747.02
  // Confirmed against the 2025 IT 1040 instruction booklet's rate table.

  //
  // Both base amounts ARE modelled, via `base_amount` on each bracket, and for
  // 2025 there are two of them. The published schedule reads "$342.00 plus
  // 2.750% of the amount in excess of $26,050", then "$2,394.32 plus 3.125%
  // ... over $100,000". The booklet spells the first out: for taxable
  // nonbusiness income of $68,050, "he owes $342 on the first $26,050 of
  // income" -- charged in full the moment income clears the threshold, a
  // genuine cliff rather than a marginal rate. Nothing at $26,050, $342.03 at
  // $26,051.
  //
  // The second is a drafting artifact of HB 96 and is deliberate here:
  // $342.00 + 2.75% x $73,950 is $2,375.63, but the statute keeps the older
  // $2,394.32 base above $100,000. That is a further $18.69 step at that
  // boundary, and it is the enacted text, so it is modelled as written rather
  // than smoothed. See isBaseAmountSchedule in utils/calculator.
  // Ohio's personal exemption, ORC 5747.025 -- IT 1040 line 4, subtracted from
  // Ohio AGI to reach the income tax base the rate schedule above is charged
  // on. See "What the slot actually holds" in src/data/README.md.
  //
  // Tiered by modified adjusted gross income, and indexed annually, so it is
  // a schedule rather than a number. A joint return claims two exemptions
  // (the filer and the spouse), which is why MARRIED is double at every tier;
  // the tiers themselves are the same on an individual or a joint return.
  // Ohio has no head-of-household status, so that filer claims one.
  //
  // The top band is new: ORC 5747.025(A) allows no exemption at all once
  // modified AGI reaches $750,000, a cliff rather than a taper.
  //
  // MODELLED: the no-dependants case. The exemption is also claimed for each
  // dependent on the federal return, and the calculator has no dependants
  // input. Same treatment as Michigan's $600 exemption.
  //
  // This interacts with the base amount above: the $26,050 threshold is
  // measured against income *after* this exemption, so it moves who sits over
  // the cliff. A filer on $28,000 of wages is under it once the exemption is
  // taken, and owes nothing.
