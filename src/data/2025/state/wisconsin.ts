  // Wisconsin's standard deduction shrinks as income rises, so it is a
  // schedule rather than one number per filing status. Each band below is one
  // printed row of the DOR's own schedule; the amounts here are the maxima
  // that used to be stored alone, which a filer only gets at the very bottom
  // of the income range.
  //
  // Two things to know when transcribing one of these:
  //
  //  * Bands are half-open, [min, max). A printed row reading "over $X but not
  //    over $Y" becomes `min: X + 1, max: Y + 1`, so every boundary below is
  //    one dollar above the figure on the page.
  //  * Head of household phases out twice. It falls at 22.515% until it meets
  //    the single taxpayer's schedule, then continues on that schedule -- and
  //    the DOR keeps measuring the second stage from the *first* threshold,
  //    which is what `reduce_from` is for. The two formulas agree to within a
  //    few cents at the crossover, which is how the crossover was chosen.

  // Verified: evaluated at the midpoint of each $500 step, this schedule
  // reproduces every row of the Form 1 Standard Deduction Table exactly, for
  // all four filing statuses. The calculator evaluates at the taxpayer's own
  // income rather than snapping to a step, so it can sit up to half a step
  // away from the printed table -- at most about $50 of deduction for a joint
  // filer, $30 for a single one, which is a couple of dollars of tax.
