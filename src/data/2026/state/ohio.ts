  // Verified 2026-09-07: rates and boundaries correct. HB 96 finished the
  // flattening -- one rate above the $26,050 exemption, no $100,000 step.
  // Source: ORC 5747.02(A)(3)(c), "For taxable years beginning in 2026 and
  // thereafter, $332.00 plus 2.75% of the amount in excess of $26,050".
  // https://codes.ohio.gov/ohio-revised-code/section-5747.02
  //
  // The $332.00 base amount IS modelled, via `base_amount` on each bracket.
  // Ohio does not tax the first $26,050 marginally: the statute charges a flat
  // $332 (the 1.27448% estate rate applied to $26,050) the moment taxable
  // nonbusiness income clears the threshold, so the tax function genuinely
  // steps -- nothing at $26,050, $332.03 at $26,051. Reading the schedule
  // marginally undercharged every Ohio filer above $26,050 by the full base.
  // See isBaseAmountSchedule in utils/calculator.
  //
  // The $26,050 threshold is indexed annually by the tax commissioner under
  // ORC 5747.02(A)(5), each August, to the nearest $50. It has held at $26,050
  // since 2022; re-check once the 2026 IT 1040 instructions are posted.
  // Ohio's personal exemption, ORC 5747.025 -- IT 1040 line 4, subtracted from
  // Ohio AGI to reach the income tax base the rate schedule above is charged
  // on. See "What the slot actually holds" in src/data/README.md.
  //
  // Tiered by modified adjusted gross income, and indexed annually, so it is
  // a schedule rather than a number. A joint return claims two exemptions
  // (the filer and the spouse), which is why MARRIED is double at every tier;
  // the tiers themselves are the same on an individual or a joint return.
  // Ohio has no head-of-household status, so that filer claims one.
  //
  // The top band is new: ORC 5747.025(A) allows no exemption at all once
  // modified AGI reaches $500,000, a cliff rather than a taper.
  //
  // MODELLED: the no-dependants case. The exemption is also claimed for each
  // dependent on the federal return, and the calculator has no dependants
  // input. Same treatment as Michigan's $600 exemption.
  //
  // This interacts with the base amount above: the $26,050 threshold is
  // measured against income *after* this exemption, so it moves who sits over
  // the cliff. A filer on $28,000 of wages is under it once the exemption is
  // taken, and owes nothing.
