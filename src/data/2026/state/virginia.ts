// Verified 2026-09-08 against the Virginia Department of Taxation's Form 760
// instructions for 2025, which speak for 2026 as well:
// https://www.tax.virginia.gov/sites/default/files/vatax-pdf/2025-760-instructions.pdf
//
// Standard deduction — VERIFIED $8,750 single / $17,500 joint / $8,750 married
// separate, unchanged from 2025. What's new states the span outright: the 2025
// session "increased the standard deduction for Taxable Years 2025 and 2026
// from $8,500 to $8,750 for single filers and from $17,000 to $17,500 for
// married filers filing jointly."
//
// Watch item for 2027: the same paragraph says "The increase in the standard
// deduction is scheduled to sunset after Taxable Year 2026 and revert to the
// standard deduction amounts that" preceded it. Unless the General Assembly
// extends it again — as it has each time so far — TY2027 falls back to
// $3,000 / $6,000 under Va. Code 58.1-322.03.
//
// Rate schedule — VERIFIED unchanged: "Not over $3,000, your tax is 2%", then
// $3,000-$5,000 "$60 + 3%", $5,000-$17,000 "$120 + 5%", over $17,000
// "$720 + 5.75%". The cumulative column reconciles only with these boundaries:
// 3,000 x 2% = $60, + 2,000 x 3% = $120, + 12,000 x 5% = $720. Virginia's rates
// have not moved since 1990 (Va. Code 58.1-320) and no 2026 legislation touches
// them, so all four schedules below are identical by design.
//
// Head of household is not a separate Virginia filing status — a head of
// household files under Filing Status 1 (single), which is why that slot
// carries the single amount. Married filing separately also takes the full
// single amount, not half of joint.
//
// No payroll, disability or paid-leave tax: Virginia levies none on employees.
