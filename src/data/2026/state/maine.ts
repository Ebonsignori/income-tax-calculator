  // L.D. 2212 (P.L. 2025, c. 650, Pt. K, SS14) replaced Maine's indexed
  // formula with flat 2026 amounts in 36 M.R.S. 5124-C(1-C). Maine returns
  // to the federal standard deduction in 2027 under 5124-C(1-D).
  //
  // Maine's deduction is not flat: 36 M.R.S. 5124-C(2) phases it out over a
  // fixed span of Maine AGI, so this is a schedule. The amounts this file
  // used to carry alone are the base amounts, which survive intact only up to
  // the threshold below and are gone entirely one span above it.
  //
  // The rule is the Worksheet for Standard / Itemized Deductions printed with
  // Form 1040ME, line 17. In its own steps: take Maine AGI, subtract the
  // threshold (line 2), divide the excess by the span (line 4) capping the
  // quotient at 1.0000 (line 5), multiply the base deduction by that fraction
  // (line 7) and subtract the product (line 8). So the deduction falls in a
  // straight line from the base amount at the threshold to zero one span
  // above it, which is `reduce_rate` = base / span, measured from the
  // threshold. The span is the same every year: $75,000 single and married
  // filing separately, $112,500 head of household, $150,000 filing jointly.
  //
  // The worksheet is "greater than" the threshold, so each band starts one
  // dollar above the printed figure.
  //
  // MRS rounds its line 5 fraction to four decimal places and the calculator
  // does not. Sampled across the phase-out range the two never differ by more
  // than a dollar of deduction, and only where the exact figure lands on a
  // half dollar and the two round it opposite ways - about seven cents of
  // tax. The divergence is unsigned - the calculator runs a dollar low at 2025
  // head of household on $192,188 and a dollar high at 2026 head of household
  // on $215,275 - so do not try to correct for it in one direction.
  //
  // Cross-checked against the worksheet. Single at $139,750: excess 37,500,
  // 37,500 / 75,000 = 0.5000, 15,700 x 0.5 = 7,850 reduced, deduction
  // $7,850 - and 37,500 x 20.933333% = 7,849.99999, $7,850 rounded. Joint
  // at $279,550: excess 75,000, quotient 0.5000, deduction $15,700. Single
  // at $177,250: excess 75,000, quotient 1.0000, deduction $0, which is
  // where the third band starts.
