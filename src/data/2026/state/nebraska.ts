  // UNSOURCED: HEAD_OF_HOUSEHOLD. Nebraska publishes it only in the Form
  // 1040N booklet, which is not out for 2026, and the 2026 Circular EN
  // withholds head-of-household filers as single so it carries no figure.
  // 12950 is derived - 12,600 scaled by the confirmed single-filer increase
  // (8,600 -> 8,850, +2.907%) and rounded to the nearest $50, the rounding
  // Nebraska uses. Re-check against the 2026 booklet when it publishes.

  // Nebraska publishes FOUR bands for 2026 - single 0-4,130 / 4,130-24,760 /
  // 24,760-39,900 / over 39,900 - but Neb. Rev. Stat. 77-2715.03 sets both
  // rate three and rate four to 4.55% for 2026 (they split again at 3.99% in
  // 2027), so bands 3 and 4 carry the same rate and collapsing them is
  // arithmetically identical and reads better in the bracket ladder. If a
  // future year gives those bands different rates, split them back out at
  // 39,900 single and separate, 79,800 joint, 59,160 head of household.
