  // filers at the single amount, so no final figure exists. Publication
  // OR-ESTIMATE 2026 (150-101-026, Rev. 10-07-25) lists 4,650, but it
  // labels its whole set "Estimated Oregon indexed figures" and the later
  // withholding revision raised its single and joint estimates by $10 and
  // $20, so 4,650 is likely low too. 4680 is 4,560 scaled by the confirmed
  // single-filer increase, which also preserves the ~1.61x head-of-household
  // ratio Oregon has held since 2023. Re-check against Table 5 when the
  // 2026 OR-40 instructions publish.
