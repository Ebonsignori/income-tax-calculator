// CARRIED FROM 2025 -- brackets and standard deduction only.
//
// California indexes both for inflation under R&TC 17041(h), but as of
// 2026-09-07 the FTB has not published the 2026 figures: there is no 2026 Form
// 540 booklet, and FTB Tax News carries no indexing announcement. The FTB's
// own 2026 Form 540-ES worksheet tells taxpayers to estimate 2026 tax with the
// 2025 standard deduction ($5,706 / $11,412) and the 2025 tax table, which is
// exactly what this file does.
// https://www.ftb.ca.gov/forms/2026/2026-540-es-instructions.pdf
//
// Revisit once the 2026 540 booklet is posted (typically December).

  // The 13.3% top band is the 12.3% statutory top rate plus the 1% surcharge
  // on taxable income over $1,000,000 (R&TC 17043), now called the Behavioral
  // Health Services Tax. It applies at $1,000,000 for *every* filing status --
  // the threshold is not doubled for a joint return. The surcharge was missing
  // from this year entirely, so every filer above $1,000,000 was undertaxed by
  // a percentage point; added 2026-09-07 to match the 2023 file. Unlike the
  // bracket boundaries the $1,000,000 threshold is statutory, not indexed, so
  // it is not provisional.
  //
  // Read this band as what it is: a 1% surcharge on taxable income above
  // $1,000,000, levied separately on Form 540 line 62. It is not a statutory
  // rate bracket -- California's rate schedule tops out at 12.3% -- and it is
  // folded into the top band here only because a marginal bracket list is the
  // one shape this data model has. Do not carry 13.3% into anything that
  // means to quote the FTB rate schedule.
  //
  // Not modelled: California's exemption credits (Form 540 line 32), which
  // are per-taxpayer dollar credits against tax rather than a deduction, and
  // so cannot be expressed as brackets.
