  // 3925 x 2 = 7850 and 11775 / 0.75 = 15700. Head of household is the
  // statutory $9,000 base run through the same 32 V.S.A. 5811(21)(D)
  // inflation adjustment, which also reproduces those two figures and the
  // $5,400 personal exemption the guide prints outright.
  // Replace these with the IN-111-2026 amounts once that form is posted.

  // Vermont Tax Rate Schedules X (single), Y-1 (joint), Y-2 (separate) and Z
  // (head of household). Each status has its own thresholds - none is a
  // multiple or a copy of another.
  // Do NOT source these from GB-1210, the income tax WITHHOLDING guide. Its
  // annual percentage tables carry the same rates but every threshold is
  // shifted up by half the standard deduction, so they are not rate
  // schedules. (Confusingly, the file the Department names RateSched-2025 /
  // RateSched-2026 is the withholding wage-bracket chart; the rate schedule
  // is TaxRateSched-YYYY or the table inside the IN-111 instructions.)
  // PROVISIONAL: these are the "2026 Preliminary Vermont Tax Rates" printed
  // in the 2026 Form IN-114 instructions (Rev. 10/25). Vermont has not yet
  // published the final 2026 rate schedule; replace when it posts.

  // Not modelled: for federal AGI over $150,000 Vermont charges the greater

  // line 8). The schedule wins at every income this calculator produces.
