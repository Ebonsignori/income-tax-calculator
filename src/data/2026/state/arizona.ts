  // PROVISIONAL, checked 2026-09-08 and left as it stands. These are the
  // federal TY2026 amounts (IRS Rev. Proc. 2025-32). ADOR has not published
  // an Arizona 2026 figure yet: the 2026 Form 140ES booklet tells filers to
  // estimate using "your total allowable 2025 standard deduction", and the
  // Arizona amount is only announced in the TY2026 Form 140 booklet, due
  // January 2027.
  //
  // Kept because Arizona's published amount has equalled the federal one
  // exactly in every year that has been published -- 2023, 2024 and 2025,
  // the last of those including the OBBBA increase -- so the federal figure
  // is the best-grounded stand-in rather than a guess. Re-check when the
  // TY2026 booklet appears.
