      // understated a resident by about 45%: $354 a year at $100,000 and $842

      // standard deduction while Y-203 charges gross Yonkers wages.

      // credits and it is a trap: it would copy the state's schedule into a
      // second place, so the next state rate change would go stale here, and
      // it would put bands at rates like 0.98825% on the tax-tables page that
      // appear in no published document. `basis: STATE_INCOME_TAX_BASIS`
      // charges the rate on whatever the state tax came to.

      // MODELLED without credits: worksheet lines b to i subtract the college
      // tuition credit, the household credit and others before the 16.75%
      // applies, and the calculator models none of them, so this is the
      // surcharge on the full state tax.
