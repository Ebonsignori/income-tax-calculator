  // Verified correct and unchanged from 2025. HB 252 (Laws 2024, ch. 67,
  // Section 5) wrote this table into NMSA 1978 Section 7-2-7 for "any taxable
  // year beginning on or after January 1, 2025" with no inflation-adjustment
  // clause, so it carries forward until amended. It has not been: the 2025
  // session touched Sections 7-2-12, 7-2-18.38 and 7-2-31.1 but not 7-2-7, and
  // the only income-tax act of the 2026 session was SB-151, corporate income
  // tax (LS-2025 and LS-2026 Legislative Summaries).
  // Corroborated by the withholding tables in force for wages paid on or after
  // January 1, 2026, which run the same 1.5/3.2/4.3/4.7/4.9/5.9 ladder over the
  // same bracket widths (FYI-104 Rev. 11/2025, monthly single: breakpoints
  // $2,046, $3,463, $6,213 and $18,171 x 12 sit a constant ~$8,054 above
  // $16,500, $33,500, $66,500 and $210,000). Those are withholding thresholds,
  // not the rate schedule -- the schedule below is Section 7-2-7 verbatim.
  // Head of household shares the joint schedule per Section 7-2-7(A).
