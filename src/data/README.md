# Data

All tax bracket data is organized by TypeScript files that each export a default object:

- `{year}/federal.ts` - Values for each tax (e.g. income, medicare, social security) by filing status for the `{year}`

- `{year}/state/{state}.ts` - Values for each `{state}` level tax by filing status for the `{year}`. Any city-specific taxes are under the `[CITIES]` key.

For a complete example including state income tax, standard deductions, payroll taxes, and city-specific taxes, see [2025/state/oregon.ts](./2025/state/oregon.ts).

## Rate

`rate` is expressed as a percentage,

Examples:

- 0.58% = `rate: 0.58`
- 1.25% = `rate: 1.25`
- 13% = `rate: 13`

## Naming

Make sure to use `snake_case` for all state, city, and tax names.

Rather than adding string literals for city & tax names, add and reference a constant variable in the relevant [constants](../constants/) file.

- City names go in [cities.ts](../constants/cities.ts)

- Tax type names go in [tax-types.ts](../constants/tax_types.ts)

## File organization

The default object in each file is organized in the following format:

```typescript
import type { TaxData } from "@/types";

export default {
  "tax type": {
    "filing status": [
      { min: number, max: number, rate: number }  // Progressive tax brackets
      ||
      { min: number, amount: number }              // Flat fee (e.g., min: 1000, amount: 35)
      ||
      { ..., percent_of_total: number }            // Employee portion (e.g., 60 = 60% employee, 40% employer)
      ...
    ]
  }
} as TaxData;
```

**Filing Status:**

- Use specific filing statuses ([SINGLE, MARRIED, etc.](../constants/filing_status.ts)) for taxes that vary by status
- Use `ALL` for taxes applied the same way regardless of filing status (e.g., payroll taxes)

**Special Formats:**

- **Standard deductions**: Single number per filing status, not brackets (e.g., `[SINGLE]: 2835`) — or, for the states that shrink it as income rises, a schedule of bands. See [Standard deductions that phase out](#standard-deductions-that-phase-out).
- **INFINITY constant**: Use for the max of the highest bracket (e.g., `{ min: 250000, max: INFINITY, rate: 9.9 }`)
- **City taxes**: Nested under `[CITIES]: { [CITY_NAME]: { ... } }`

## Rate brackets must be contiguous

One bracket's `max` is the next bracket's `min` — the same number, written twice:

```typescript
{ min: 0,    max: 5500,  rate: 0 },
{ min: 5500, max: 10900, rate: 2 },   // not min: 5501, and not a previous max of 5499
```

A bracket is the range _above_ its `min` up to and including its `max`. Writing
`max: 5499` next to `min: 5500` leaves a dollar taxed at no rate, and the tax
tables render bracket floors from this convention, so mixing the two styles
makes the displayed range wrong too. `npm run validate-tax-data` enforces this.

Every filing status a tax defines must define all four — a partial set means the
calculator is handed `undefined` for the missing ones. Use `[ALL]` when the tax
does not vary by status.

## Rate lookups

Most rate schedules are marginal: each bracket taxes the slice of income between
its `min` and `max`. A few taxes instead use their bands to _pick_ a rate, which
is then charged on the whole base. Those set `rate_on_total` on every bracket:

```typescript
{ min: 0,     max: 32344,    rate: 0,    rate_on_total: true },
{ min: 32344, max: INFINITY, rate: 0.44, rate_on_total: true },   // 0.44% of everything
```

At $100,000 that is $440, not the $302.26 a marginal reading gives. Eugene's
community safety payroll tax is the only one so far; the City's published rate
chart states the rule outright — its purpose is "to obtain the rate to be
applied to all subject wages paid in a pay period."

Note the cliff this creates at the threshold, which is real: a dollar more in
wages turns $0 into $142.31.

Two jurisdictions need this so far, so it is a recurring shape rather than a
one-off: Eugene's community safety payroll tax, and Frederick County, Maryland,
whose local tax Form 502 Worksheet 19A computes by "multiply the taxable net
income by your local tax rate" — with no "plus $X" base amount of the kind
Anne Arundel's schedule carries.

## Which income a rate is charged on

By default the income base comes from the tax type — `grossIncomeTaxes` in
`utils/calculator.ts` lists the ones computed on wages (FICA, the state
paid-leave programs, the local occupational and payroll taxes); everything else
is computed on income after deductions.

**"Gross" means true wages: before deductions _and_ before any pre-tax
retirement contribution.** A 401(k) elective deferral reduces W-2 box 1 only —
boxes 3 and 5, the Social Security and Medicare wage figures, are unchanged by
it, because elective deferrals stay "subject to Social Security (FICA),
Medicare, and federal unemployment taxes" (IRS Topic No. 424). A deductible
traditional IRA contribution is a deduction on the 1040, taken out of wages that
were already taxed for FICA. So the 401(k) / IRA figure the calculator collects
belongs in the taxable-income line and nowhere else.

Where the tax type alone does not settle it, a schedule says so with `basis`.
`city_income` is the case that needs it, because that one key covers three
different bases:

- `"gross"` — the Kansas City and St. Louis earnings taxes on "salaries, wages,
  commissions and other compensation" (RSMo 92.111), Wilmington's on "the total
  income from whatever source earned" (22 Del. C. 903), and Ohio's municipal
  taxes on "qualifying wages" as defined by IRC 3121(a) (ORC 718.01(R)).
- `"taxable"` — the default, correct for a city or county tax that genuinely
  starts from state taxable income, as Maryland's counties and Indiana's do.
- `"state_income_tax"` — charged on the state's computed tax rather than on any
  income figure. Yonkers' resident surcharge is 16.75% of New York State tax
  (IT-201 line 55), not a rate on income.

That last one exists to stop the state's schedule being copied into a second
place. Multiplying New York's nine brackets by 0.1675 is exact for a filer with
no credits, and it would go stale the next time New York changes a rate. Only a
city rate schedule may declare it, it must be a single bracket spanning 0 to
`INFINITY`, and `npm run validate-tax-data` enforces both.

`rate_on_total` and `basis` describe the whole schedule but are written per
bracket, and the calculator reads them off the first one. `npm run
validate-tax-data` rejects a schedule that sets either on only some brackets.

## Flat fees

A fixed-dollar tax uses `amount` instead of `rate`:

```typescript
{ min: 6000, amount: 5.75, frequency: "monthly" }   // Denver: $5.75/mo above $6,000
```

- `min` is **inclusive** — income _at_ the threshold owes the fee.
- `frequency` annualizes the amount (`weekly`, `biweekly`, `semi_monthly`,
  `monthly`, `annually`). Omit it for a fee that is already annual.
- `basis` picks which income figure the threshold is measured against:
  `"gross"` (the default — true wages, before deductions and before any
  retirement contribution, the same figure the gross-basis rate schedules use)
  or `"taxable"` (after both). Most thresholds are written against gross wages;
  Portland's 2026 Arts Tax is the exception and tests Oregon taxable income, so
  it sets `basis: TAXABLE_INCOME_BASIS`.
- `amount` must land on a whole cent.

Where a schedule lists several tiers, the highest one the taxpayer qualifies for
applies; fees are not cumulative. The tier is chosen by its `min`, not by its
position in the array, so the order tiers are written in does not change the
fee.

## Standard deductions that phase out

### What the slot actually holds

`standard_deduction` holds **whatever the state subtracts from income before
applying its rate**, not literally a thing called a standard deduction. Some
states call it a personal exemption instead — Connecticut's figures in this
slot are its personal exemption, and Illinois, New Jersey and Ohio have
exemption allowances of the same kind. They belong here: the calculator's
question is what gets subtracted, and a filer does not care what the form calls
it. A state that has both would carry their sum, with a comment saying so.

### Deductions that vary with income

Most states allow the same standard deduction at every income, and those are one
number per filing status. Five — Alabama, Connecticut, Maine, Montana and
Wisconsin — shrink it as income rises, and one number cannot say that. Storing
only the maximum over-deducts for most filers in those states: Alabama's joint
deduction is $8,500 at the bottom of the range and $5,000 for anyone above about
$35,500, and it is the $5,000 that ADOR's own withholding example uses.

Those statuses take an array of bands instead:

```typescript
[STANDARD_DEDUCTION]: {
  [SINGLE]: [
    { min: 0,      max: 19550,    amount: 13560 },
    { min: 19550,  max: 132550,   amount: 13560, reduce_rate: 12 },
    { min: 132550, max: INFINITY, amount: 0 },
  ],
  [MARRIED]: 25110,   // a flat status can sit next to a banded one
  ...
}
```

- `min` / `max` bound the income the band applies to. Bands are **half-open**,
  `[min, max)`, and contiguous, so one band's `max` is the next one's `min`.
  Note this differs from the rate-bracket convention above: a schedule printed
  as "over $19,549 but not over $132,549" becomes `min: 19550, max: 132550`,
  one dollar up on both ends.
- `amount` is the deduction before this band's reduction.
- `reduce_rate` takes a percentage of the income above `reduce_from`. Use it
  where the state publishes a rate ("$13,560 less 12%").
- `reduce_per` and `reduce_by` take a fixed amount for each whole step. Use them
  where the state publishes a chart of increments ("$175 for each $500"). A band
  uses one form or the other, never both.
- `reduce_from` is the income the reduction is measured from, defaulting to
  `min`. Set it only where the published schedule measures from somewhere else.
- `percent_of_income` makes the deduction a straight percentage of income
  instead, clamped into `[floor, amount]` — a schedule that *rises* to a cap
  rather than phasing out. Montana through tax year 2023: "20% of Montana AGI",
  floored at $2,460 and capped at $5,540. Cannot be combined with the reduce
  fields.
- `floor` is the least the band allows. Defaults to 0. Alabama floors at
  $5,000.

A band needs none of the reduce fields, which is how a **cliff** is written — a
deduction allowed in full up to a threshold and not at all above it. Illinois
disallows its exemption allowance entirely above $250,000 of base income ("you
are not entitled to an exemption allowance on Line 10. Enter 'zero'"):

```typescript
[SINGLE]: [
  { min: 0,       max: 250000,   amount: 2850 },
  { min: 250000,  max: INFINITY, amount: 0 },
],
```

A cliff and a taper share a representation but are different things, so it is
worth knowing the cliff is expressible before going looking for a field to
express it with.

The first band must start at 0 and the last must end at `INFINITY`, so every
income lands in exactly one. `npm run validate-tax-data` enforces that, along
with contiguity and the rule that a schedule moves in one direction only — a
deduction that both rises and falls means a band is transcribed wrong.

### Which income the band is chosen by

Income after retirement contributions, before the deduction itself — the same
figure that feeds taxable income. That is a **proxy for AGI**, which is what
these states actually key on; the two differ by above-the-line items this
calculator does not model. It is deliberately not the gross wage figure that
FICA uses, which ignores the retirement contribution.

### Transcribing one

Work from the schedule the state publishes as a formula, not from a lookup table
if it prints both — Wisconsin's Form 1 table is 274 rows per year. Each band
should be one printed row, so a reviewer can hold the file next to the source.

Wisconsin's head of household is the awkward case worth knowing about: it falls
at 22.515% until it meets the single taxpayer's schedule, then continues on that
schedule — and the DOR keeps measuring that second stage from the *first*
threshold. That is what `reduce_from` exists for. See
[2025/state/wisconsin.ts](./2025/state/wisconsin.ts) for the worked example.

A state that publishes both a formula and a stepped table will not agree with
itself exactly: the table is the formula evaluated at each step's midpoint. The
calculator evaluates at the filer's own income, so it can sit up to half a step
from the printed table — a couple of dollars of tax.

For example a `federal.ts` file might contain part of this object,

```js
import { INFINITY } from "@/constants";
import { SINGLE } from "@/constants/filing_status";
import { INCOME } from "@/constants/tax_types";

export default {
  [INCOME]: {
    [SINGLE]: [
      { min: 0, max: 11000, rate: 10 },
      { min: 11000, max: 44725, rate: 12 },
      { min: 44725, max: 95375, rate: 22 },
      { min: 95375, max: 182100, rate: 24 },
      { min: 182100, max: 231250, rate: 32 },
      { min: 231250, max: 578125, rate: 35 },
      { min: 578125, max: INFINITY, rate: 37 },
    ],
  },
};
```

## Contributing

When adding a new state or city:

1. Create/update the state file: `{year}/state/{state_name}.ts`
2. Add constants to:
   - [states.ts](../constants/states.ts) - if adding a new state
   - [cities.ts](../constants/cities.ts) - if adding a new city
   - [tax_types.ts](../constants/tax_types.ts) - if adding a new tax type
3. Validate: `npm run validate-tax-data`
4. Test: `npm test`

## Why

We split the files up like this for [code splitting](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/lazy-loading#nextdynamic) so that the entire JSON database of brackets isn't sent to the user when they load the page. Instead the client will fetch the necessary files as needed based on the user's selection.
