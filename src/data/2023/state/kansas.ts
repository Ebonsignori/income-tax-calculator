  // MARRIED_SEPARATELY being exactly half of MARRIED is real, not a
  // derivation: K.S.A. 79-32,119(d) fixes the separate-return deduction
  // "on the basis that separate federal returns were filed", and the
  // booklet prints the exact half.
  // Source: 2023 K-40 booklet, "Kansas Standard Deduction" (line 4), and
  // K.S.A. 79-32,119(c)(1), which sets 3,500 / 8,000 / 6,000 for tax years
  // 2021 through 2023.
