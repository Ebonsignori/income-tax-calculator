  // Verified correct. New Mexico did not index or otherwise change its brackets
  // between 2021 and 2024: NMSA 1978 Section 7-2-7, as rewritten by HB 6 (Laws
  // 2019, ch. 270, Section 12), fixed this table "for any taxable year
  // beginning on or after January 1, 2021" with no inflation adjustment, and it
  // stood until HB 252 replaced it for 2025. So 2023 and 2024 holding the same
  // schedule is the published position, not a stale copy.
  // Section 7-2-7's printed cumulative figures pin the boundaries: single
  // $93.50 = 1.7% x $5,500; $269.50 = $93.50 + 3.2% x $5,500; $504.50 =
  // $269.50 + 4.7% x $5,000; $10,010.50 = $504.50 + 4.9% x $194,000. Joint:
  // $136 / $392 / $768 / $15,027. Separate: $68 / $196 / $384 / $7,513.50.
  // The 2023 PIT-TRT look-up table agrees independently -- its tax at the
  // $95,900-$96,000 row (midpoint $95,950) is $4,422 single, $4,294 joint and
  // head of household, $4,498 separate, all reproduced here to the dollar.
  // Head of household shares the joint schedule (Section 7-2-7(B) covers
  // "heads of household, surviving spouses and married individuals filing
  // joint returns").
