  //    20,000 x 6.5%   = $1,300.00   -> $3,500    at the $60,000 floor
  //   190,000 x 8.5%   = $16,150.00  -> $19,650   at the $250,000 floor
  //   250,000 x 9.25%  = $23,125.00  -> $42,775   at the $500,000 floor
  //   500,000 x 9.75%  = $48,750.00  -> $91,525   at the $1,000,000 floor
  // every figure matching the printed "$X, plus Y% of the excess" column.
