  // The published schedule reads: $0-$26,050 at 0%; then "$360.69 plus 2.750%
  // of the amount in excess of $26,050"; then "$2,394.32 plus 3.688% ... over
  // $100,000"; then "$2,958.58 plus 3.750% ... over $115,300". Those cumulative
  // figures confirm the boundaries: $360.69 + 2.75% x $73,950 = $2,394.32, and
  // $2,394.32 + 3.688% x $15,300 = $2,958.58.
  //
  // The $360.69 base amount IS modelled, via `base_amount` on each bracket.
  // Ohio does not tax the first $26,050 marginally: ORC 5747.02(A)(3) charges
  // a flat $360.69 (the estate rate applied to $26,050) the moment taxable
  // nonbusiness income clears the threshold, so the tax function genuinely
  // steps -- nothing at $26,050, $360.72 at $26,051. Reading the schedule
  // marginally undercharged every Ohio filer above $26,050 by the full base.
  // Each band's base is the tax owed at its own floor, exactly as published;
  // see isBaseAmountSchedule in utils/calculator.
  //
  // The bases here are continuous with the rates, which is the arithmetic the
  // boundaries were confirmed from above: $360.69 + 2.75% x $73,950 = the
  // $2,394.32 stated at $100,000, and $2,394.32 + 3.688% x $15,300 = the
  // $2,958.58 stated at $115,300. So 2023 has one discontinuity, at $26,050.
  // Ohio's personal exemption, ORC 5747.025 -- IT 1040 line 4, subtracted from
  // Ohio AGI to reach the income tax base the rate schedule above is charged
  // on. See "What the slot actually holds" in src/data/README.md.
  //
  // Tiered by modified adjusted gross income, and indexed annually, so it is
  // a schedule rather than a number. A joint return claims two exemptions
  // (the filer and the spouse), which is why MARRIED is double at every tier;
  // the tiers themselves are the same on an individual or a joint return.
  // Ohio has no head-of-household status, so that filer claims one.
  //
  // No high-income cliff this year: the statutory cap first applies for
  // taxable years beginning in 2025.
  //
  // MODELLED: the no-dependants case. The exemption is also claimed for each
  // dependent on the federal return, and the calculator has no dependants
  // input. Same treatment as Michigan's $600 exemption.
  //
  // This interacts with the base amount above: the $26,050 threshold is
  // measured against income *after* this exemption, so it moves who sits over
  // the cliff. A filer on $28,000 of wages is under it once the exemption is
  // taken, and owes nothing.
