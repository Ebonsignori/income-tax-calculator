  // CORRECTED 2026-09-08. Was 0 / 3,460 / 17,330, which is the schedule
  // printed in WH-1603F_2023.pdf -- but that file is the *withholding*
  // formula, and SCDOR publishes it in November of the preceding year off
  // the prior year's indexing. The TY2023 boundaries are 3,330 and 16,770.
  //
  // SC publishes ONE schedule used by every filing status, so the four
  // identical ladders are correct rather than a status copied over another.
  //
  // Reconciliation -- SC1041's "2023 Tax Computation Schedule for Estates and
  // Trusts" prints "3% times the amount minus $100" and "6.4% times the
  // amount minus $670", and only the correct boundaries reproduce those:
  //   3% x 3,330                       = $99.90  -> printed $100
  //   continuity at T2: 0.064*T2 - 670 = 0.03*T2 - 99.90
  //                                    -> 0.034*T2 = 570.10 -> T2 = 16,770
  //   check: 0.034 x 16,770 + 99.90    = $670.08 -> printed $670
  // The same schedule's "But less than" column reads 16,680, which would give
  // a constant of $667.02, not the $670 printed beside it. SC's own form
  // disagrees with itself here; the subtraction constant is the half that is
  // right. Independently, SC1040TT_2023 (the 1,070-row official tax table)
  // is reproduced by 3,330/16,770 at 6.4% for 1,069 of 1,070 rows -- the sole
  // miss being the row that straddles the bracket boundary -- against 67 of
  // 1,070 for the figures previously stored here.
  // Top rate 6.4% per SCDOR: "0 to a top rate of 6.4% for tax year 2023".
