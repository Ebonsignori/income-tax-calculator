  // Utah has no standard deduction, which is why this file has no
  // STANDARD_DEDUCTION key: TC-40 applies the rate to Utah taxable income
  // derived from federal AGI, with no deduction subtracted. What Utah gives
  // instead is the nonrefundable taxpayer tax credit (Utah Code 59-10-1018),
  // 6% of the federal deduction plus exemptions, phased out at 1.3% of income
  // above a base amount. It is a credit, not a subtraction, so it has no slot
  // here -- see the note in the 2025 file for what that omission costs.
  // UNMODELLED, all years: Utah's taxpayer tax credit. See the 2025 file for
  // the full note. Worth $945 at low income and exactly $0 above about
  // $90,300, so this file overstates tax below that and is right above it.
