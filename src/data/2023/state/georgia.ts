  // Schedule" (page 59). Georgia prints THREE columns, not four, and the
  // middle one is headed "Married Filing Joint or Head of Household" -- so
  // head of household shares the joint ladder here while sharing the SINGLE
  // standard deduction above. That split is Georgia's, not a mistake in this
  // file, and it is the reason the two statuses must not be assumed to move
  // together.
  //
  // The schedule's cumulative Column C reconciles with these boundaries:
  //   single: 750 x 1% = 7.50 -> printed $8; 8 + 1,500 x 2% = $38;
  //           38 + 1,500 x 3% = $83; 83 + 1,500 x 4% = $143;
  //           143 + 1,750 x 5% = 230.50 -> printed $230
  //   joint:  10 + 2,000 x 2% = $50; 50 + 2,000 x 3% = $110;
  //           110 + 2,000 x 4% = $190; 190 + 3,000 x 5% = $340
  // Married filing separately is exactly half the joint ladder, but Georgia
  // prints that column in full, so it is the state's figure and not derived.
