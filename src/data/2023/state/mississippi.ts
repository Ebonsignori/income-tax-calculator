  // Mississippi does not index its standard deduction: the amounts are fixed
  // in statute and the same table repeats every year. The DOR printed this
  // identical table in the TY2023, TY2024 and TY2025 booklets, each one
  // explicitly labelled for its own year, and the HB 531 (2022) / HB 1 (2025)
  // phase-downs changed rates only. A repeat across years is correct here,
  // not a stale copy.
  //
  // The groupings are easy to get backwards, so to be explicit:
  //   married filing jointly    $4,600
  //   married filing separately $2,300 -- exactly half the joint amount, per
  //     the DOR: "Married Filing Separate $2,300 (exactly 1/2 of the
  //     $4,600)". It equals the single amount only by coincidence.
  //   head of household         $3,400 -- MS calls this "head of family". It
  //     has its own amount and is NOT the single amount.
  //   single                    $2,300
