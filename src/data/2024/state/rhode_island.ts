  // This slot holds the SUM of two things Rhode Island subtracts, because it
  // subtracts both: the RI standard deduction (RI-1040 line 4) and the
  // personal and dependency exemption (RI-1040 line 6, $4,950 per exemption
  // from RI Schedule E). The README's rule for a state with both is to carry
  // their sum, and RI is that state -- the earlier flat figure here was the
  // deduction alone and understated every filer by a full exemption.
  //
  // Exemption count is the NO-DEPENDANTS case, the same convention the rest
  // of the repo uses: RI Schedule E counts line 1a "Yourself" and line 1b
  // "Spouse" before any dependants, so single, married filing separately and
  // head of household take one exemption and married filing jointly takes
  // two. Head of household is the honest compromise -- that status requires a
  // qualifying person, so a real head-of-household filer has at least two
  // exemptions, but modelling one here would be the only place in the repo
  // that assumes a dependant.
  //
  // The bands are RI's phase-out, which this file previously noted and did
  // not express. It is a STEP function, not a taper, and the RI-1040ES
  // Deduction Worksheet and Exemption Worksheet apply the identical rule to
  // both components -- same threshold, same increment, same chart -- which is
  // what makes summing them before phasing correct:
  //   excess = modified federal AGI - $246,450; $0 if excess > $28,200
  //   steps  = excess / $7,050, "increase to the next higher whole number"
  //   chart  = 1 -> 0.8000, 2 -> 0.6000, 3 -> 0.4000, 4 -> 0.2000
  // Rounding UP is why each band's `max` sits one dollar above the printed
  // step boundary, and why the last band drops straight from 20% to zero
  // rather than tapering into it -- $274,650 allows 20%, one dollar more
  // allows nothing. Written as plain per-band amounts because a step chart is
  // exactly that; no reduce field can express a ceiling-rounded count.
  //
  // Reconciliation: $10,550 + 1 x $4,950 = $15,500 for a single filer, and
  // 0.8/0.6/0.4/0.2 of that gives the band amounts below. The four statuses
  // share one threshold and one chart, so they differ only in that base.
