export default {
  // Alabama's optional standard deduction shrinks as Alabama AGI rises, so it
  // is a schedule rather than one number per filing status. The four figures
  // this file used to carry alone -- 3,000 single, 8,500 joint, 4,250
  // separate, 5,200 head of family -- are the maxima, and only a filer under
  // $26,000 of AGI ($13,000 filing separately) actually gets one. Above
  // $35,500 ($17,750 separately) every Alabama filer sits at the floor, which
  // is why ADOR's own withholding example deducts 5,000, not 8,500, from
  // $44,200 of joint wages.
  //
  // The 2.83x married-to-single ratio (8,500 / 3,000) is Alabama's real
  // published rule, not a data error - the four statuses are indexed off
  // separate AGI ramps rather than a common multiple. Alabama calls head of
  // household "head of family"; HEAD_OF_HOUSEHOLD below is that chart.
  //
  // ADOR publishes the rule twice, as a chart of steps and as a formula. The
  // formula is what is transcribed here, in the state's own words for the
  // joint filer:
  //
  //   - GI of $25,999 or less deduct $8,500
  //   - GI greater than $25,999 but less than $35,500
  //     deduct $8,500 less $175 for each $500 increment or part thereof of
  //     GI above $25,999
  //   - GI of $35,500 or more deduct $5,000
  //
  // "or part thereof" rounds the step count up; `reduce_per` counts whole
  // steps down. The two agree exactly if the middle band starts from the
  // chart's first reduced row rather than from the maximum -- $8,325 at
  // $26,000, then $175 off per whole $500 above that -- so every number below
  // is one printed on ADOR's chart. `floor` records the state's stated floor;
  // the third band is where it actually binds.
  //
  // A second reason the formula is the transcribed source: ADOR's chart has a
  // typo in its own joint column, identical in the 2023, 2024 and 2025
  // booklets. Its third row reads "$25,500 - $26,999  $8,150" where it must
  // read "$26,500 - $26,999" - the row above it ends at $26,499, the other
  // three columns step cleanly by their own increment, and the formula's $500
  // steps put $8,150 at $26,500. So a reviewer checking $25,500 against that
  // row will read $8,150 where this file gives $8,500, and the file is right.
  // Distrust that one cell; the rest of the chart is sound. Transcribing the
  // 21 rows literally would have transcribed the typo.
  //
  // Verified: this reproduces all 21 rows of all four charts. Joint at
  // $30,000, floor((30000 - 26000) / 500) = 8 steps, 8,325 - 8 x 175 =
  // $6,925, the chart's "$30,000 - $30,499 $6,925"; at $35,000, 18 steps,
  // 8,325 - 3,150 = $5,175, its last stepped row. Separate at $15,000,
  // floor(2000 / 250) = 8 steps, 4,162 - 8 x 88 = $3,458, matching
  // "$15,000 - $15,249 $3,458".

  // Verified 2026-09-07 against the Alabama League of Municipalities' live

  // Every one of the 25 municipalities recorded in 2026/SOURCING-STATUS.md is
  // still on it, at the same rate, and it still misspells Hackleburg as
  // "Hacklebug". No rate below changed. Alabama's 2020 HB 147 grandfathered
  // existing occupational taxes and requires legislative approval for new
  // ones, so only decreases move; Opelika's and Irondale's are the only two
  // in this data set, and both are noted at the jurisdiction below.
  // The League disclaims its own figures - rates "are those given to the
  // League by survey and should be verified with the appropriate entity" -
  // and its Opelika entry is demonstrably stale (still 1.5%, cut to 1% on
  // 2025-04-01). So treat as PROVISIONAL, corroborated by the League survey
  // alone: Bear Creek, Brilliant, Goodwater, Guin, Hackleburg, Haleyville,
  // Hamilton, Lynn, Mosses, Red Bay, Shorter, Sulligent. None of those towns
  // publishes a reachable page or ordinance.
  // Birmingham's 1% is corroborated by the League list only this round -
  // birminghamal.gov, its hdlgov tax portal and Municode all refused
  // automated fetches on 2026-09-07. That is a fetch failure, NOT new doubt:
  // Birmingham was verified against primary sources in earlier work and is
  // recorded as verified in 2026/SOURCING-STATUS.md.
  // Tarrant was added this round from the city's own ordinance - see its entry
  // below. Beaverton stays deliberately absent: its administrator (Avenu/RDS)
  // blocks access, and an unsourceable rate is worse than a missing one, since
  // absence is visibly incomplete while a wrong rate is invisibly wrong.
