  // HEAD_OF_HOUSEHOLD was 4125, which made 2023 -> 2024 a decrease in a
  // state that indexes annually and dropped the ratio to single from 1.61x
  // to 1.50x. Table 5 says 4420, which restores the 1.61x Oregon holds in
  // every other year.
  // MARRIED was 5490 = 2 x 2745. Oregon indexes and rounds each status
  // separately and publishes 5495 for 2024, so the doubling shortcut is $5
  // light. It happens to land on the published figure in 2023, 2025 and
  // 2026, which is what hid this.
  // MARRIED_SEPARATELY equals SINGLE because Table 5 splits the status in
  // two: the full single amount if your spouse also takes the standard
  // deduction, $0 if your spouse itemizes. This models the first case.
  // Source: 2024 Form OR-40 instructions, "Table 5. Standard deduction".
