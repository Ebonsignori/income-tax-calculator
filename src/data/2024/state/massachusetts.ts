  // ADDED 2026-09-08. Massachusetts has no standard deduction, so this slot
  // holds what it does subtract: the personal exemption, Form 1 line 2a.
  // "If you file a Massachusetts tax return, you're entitled to a personal
  // exemption regardless of whether you can claim a personal exemption on
  // your federal return or not." Single $4,400, married filing separate
  // $4,400, head of household $6,800, married filing joint $8,800. Same
  // treatment the audit gave Connecticut's personal exemption and the
  // Illinois, New Jersey and Ohio exemption allowances: the slot holds
  // whatever a state subtracts before applying its rate.
  //
  // Flat, with no phase-out and no indexation -- the four figures are
  // unchanged across DOR's page as revised 2022-12-30, 2024-12-05 and
  // 2026-01-06, which is what covers all four years in this repo.
  // Head of household's $6,800 is Massachusetts' own published figure for the
  // status, not a dependants assumption.
  //
  // Two further Form 1 subtractions are deliberately NOT here, both modelling
  // the no-dependants case: the $1,000 dependent exemption (line 2b), and the
  // deduction of up to $2,000 per taxpayer of Social Security and Medicare
  // tax actually paid (line 11), which nearly every W-2 filer maxes out but
  // which is computed from another tax rather than from income and has no
  // field in this schema. The second is worth about $100 of tax and leaves
  // Massachusetts modestly overstated.
