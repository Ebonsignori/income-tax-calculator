  // "You can claim a $1,000 exemption for yourself and your spouse/CU partner
  // (if filing a joint return)", so a joint return claims two. Flat: unlike
  // Illinois' and Ohio's, it does not phase out with income.
  //
  // MODELLED: the no-dependants case, and no additional exemptions. Lines 7
  // to 12 add $1,000 for being 65 or over, $1,000 for blind or disabled,
  // $6,000 for a veteran, $1,500 per dependent child and $1,000 per dependent
  // attending college; the calculator collects none of those.

    // charged against a salary. See NON_WAGE_TAX_TYPES in constants/tax_types
    // for why a tax lives in the data without being calculated.
    //
    // N.J.S.A. 40:48C-15, as amended by P.L.2018, c.68, is titled "Collection
    // of employer payroll tax by municipality" and authorises a tax "of up to
    // one percent of the employer's payroll". Newark's own Payroll Tax Booklet
    // is addressed "TO ALL EMPLOYERS" and states: "The Employer is responsible
    // for the Payroll Tax." The return is filed quarterly against the
    // business's FEIN with a $2,500/quarter de minimis on the employer's
    // payroll; there is no employee return, no employee withholding line and
    // no employee liability. Under subsection (c) an employer whose workforce
    // is more than 50% Newark residents "shall incur no payroll tax relative
    // to those Newark-resident employees" -- being a resident reduces the
    // employer's bill rather than creating one of your own.
    //
    // New Jersey authorises no municipal wage or income tax on employees at
    // all, so this is the only shape a NJ city tax can take. It was previously
    // keyed as `city_income`, alongside Yonkers, Kansas City, St. Louis and
    // Wilmington -- taxes genuinely borne by the employee -- and charged a
    // Newark resident about $1,000/yr at $100,000 that they do not owe.
    // Verified 2026-09-07 against the statute and the 2026 booklet.
