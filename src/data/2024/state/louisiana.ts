  // deduction" (La. R.S. 47:294 as it then read), not a standard deduction:
  // $4,500 for single and married filing separately, $9,000 for married
  // filing jointly, qualifying surviving spouse and head of household.
  // Head of household is grouped with JOINT, not with single. Louisiana
  // publishes a separate "2024 Louisiana Tax Table - Head of Household
  // (Filing Status Box 4)" whose headnote reads $9,000, so a sweep that
  // expects head of household to track the single amount is wrong here.
  // (The dependent step does differ: HoH adds $1,000 for each exemption
  // over one, joint for each over two. Only the base figure lives here.)
