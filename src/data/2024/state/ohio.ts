  // Verified 2026-09-07: rates and boundaries correct. Ohio collapsed the two
  // top 2023 bands (3.688% / 3.75%) into a single 3.5% band for 2024.
  // Source: ORC 5747.02(A)(3)(a), "For taxable years beginning in 2024".

  // Also Ohio Department of Taxation, Annual Tax Rates.
  // https://tax.ohio.gov/individual/resources/annual-tax-rates
  //
  // The statute's cumulative figures confirm the boundaries: $360.69 + 2.75%
  // x $73,950 = $2,394.32, which is exactly the base it states at $100,000.
  //
  // The $360.69 base amount IS modelled, via `base_amount` on each bracket.
  // Ohio does not tax the first $26,050 marginally: the statute charges a flat
  // $360.69 (the estate rate applied to $26,050) the moment taxable
  // nonbusiness income clears the threshold, so the tax function genuinely
  // steps -- nothing at $26,050, $360.72 at $26,051. Reading the schedule
  // marginally undercharged every Ohio filer above $26,050 by the full base.
  // Each band's base is the tax owed at its own floor, exactly as published;
  // see isBaseAmountSchedule in utils/calculator.
  //
  // $360.69 + 2.75% x $73,950 = the $2,394.32 the statute states at $100,000,
  // so the two bases are continuous with the rates and 2024 has a single
  // discontinuity, at $26,050.
  //
  // Collapsed to [ALL] on 2026-09-07: the four filing statuses each carried an
  // identical copy of the same schedule, which is what the [ALL] key is for
  // and what the other three years already do.
  // Ohio's personal exemption, ORC 5747.025 -- IT 1040 line 4, subtracted from
  // Ohio AGI to reach the income tax base the rate schedule above is charged
  // on. See "What the slot actually holds" in src/data/README.md.
  //
  // Tiered by modified adjusted gross income, and indexed annually, so it is
  // a schedule rather than a number. A joint return claims two exemptions
  // (the filer and the spouse), which is why MARRIED is double at every tier;
  // the tiers themselves are the same on an individual or a joint return.
  // Ohio has no head-of-household status, so that filer claims one.
  //
  // No high-income cliff this year: the statutory cap first applies for
  // taxable years beginning in 2025.
  //
  // MODELLED: the no-dependants case. The exemption is also claimed for each
  // dependent on the federal return, and the calculator has no dependants
  // input. Same treatment as Michigan's $600 exemption.
  //
  // This interacts with the base amount above: the $26,050 threshold is
  // measured against income *after* this exemption, so it moves who sits over
  // the cliff. A filer on $28,000 of wages is under it once the exemption is
  // taken, and owes nothing.
