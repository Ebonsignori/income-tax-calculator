  // Verified correct, and identical to 2023 on purpose. NMSA 1978 Section 7-2-7
  // as rewritten by HB 6 (Laws 2019, ch. 270, Section 12) fixed this table "for
  // any taxable year beginning on or after January 1, 2021" with no inflation
  // adjustment; nothing amended it until HB 252 replaced it for 2025. New
  // Mexico does not index its brackets, so 2021 through 2024 all share this
  // schedule.
  // The 2024 PIT-TRT look-up table confirms it independently: at the
  // $99,900-$100,000 row (midpoint $99,950) the tax is $4,618 single, $4,490
  // joint and head of household, $4,694 separate, all reproduced here to the
  // dollar. Its top-bracket bases ($10,008 single, $15,025 joint, $7,512
  // separate) are unchanged from 2023, confirming the schedule did not move.
  // Head of household shares the joint schedule per Section 7-2-7(B).
