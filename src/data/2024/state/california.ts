  // Verified 2026-09-07 against the 2024 California Tax Rate Schedules
  // (Schedule X / Y / Z, page 75 of the 540 booklet, link above). The
  // schedule's cumulative "enter on Form 540, line 31" column confirms each
  // boundary independently: Schedule Y at $1,442,628 reads $140,232.77, which
  // is the $75,025.67 owed at $865,574 plus 11.3% of the $577,054 in between.
  //
  // The 13.3% top band is the 12.3% statutory top rate plus the 1% Mental
  // Health Services Tax (R&TC 17043). The 540 booklet's line 62 worksheet
  // applies that 1% to taxable income over $1,000,000 for *every* filing
  // status -- the threshold is not doubled for a joint return. The surcharge
  // was missing from this year entirely, so every filer above $1,000,000 was
  // undertaxed by a percentage point; added 2026-09-07 to match the 2023 file.
  //
  // Read this band as what it is: a 1% surcharge on taxable income above
  // $1,000,000, levied separately on Form 540 line 62. It is not a statutory
  // rate bracket -- California's rate schedule tops out at 12.3% -- and it is
  // folded into the top band here only because a marginal bracket list is the
  // one shape this data model has. Do not carry 13.3% into anything that
  // means to quote the FTB rate schedule.
  //
  // Not modelled: California's exemption credits (Form 540 line 32), which
  // are per-taxpayer dollar credits against tax rather than a deduction, and
  // so cannot be expressed as brackets.

  // No [CITIES] key, and that is a finding rather than a gap: California law

  // 17041.5, which provides that "no city, county, city and county ... shall
  // levy or collect or cause to be levied or collected any tax upon the
  // income, or any part thereof, of any person," carving out only an
  // "otherwise authorized license tax upon a business measured by or

  // San Francisco is the counterexample people reach for, and it lands
  // squarely inside that carve-out. Its Gross Receipts Tax, Homelessness
  // Gross Receipts Tax, Commercial Rents Tax, and Overpaid Executive Gross
  // Receipts Tax are all owed by the business and none are withheld from a
  // paycheck. The Payroll Expense Tax that stale sources -- including
  // Wikipedia's state-income-tax article, which still lists "San Francisco
  // (payroll only)" -- keep citing was the same species: a business license
  // tax measured by payroll, not a tax on an employee's income. Prop E (2012)
  // phased its rate to zero as the Gross Receipts Tax phased in.
  //
  // So a California wage earner's only sub-federal taxes are the two above,
  // state income tax and SDI. This holds for every California city and every
  // year; do not open this question again without a change to 17041.5.
