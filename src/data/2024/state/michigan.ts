    // Rates verified 2026-09-07 against the Michigan City Income Tax Act and
    // the cities' own ordinances; no change in any of the four years.
    // MCL 141.611 sets the default at 1% resident / 0.5% non-resident, and the
    // only ways above it are closed classes: MCL 141.503(2)(d) gives a city
    // over 600,000 (Detroit alone) 2.40%/1.20%; MCL 141.503a(2) gives 2%/1% on
    // a pre-Nov-1988 vote (Highland Park); MCL 141.503c gives 1.5%/0.75%
    // (Grand Rapids, Saginaw). So no other Michigan city can exceed 1%.
    // These are the RESIDENT rates, which is what a take-home calculator wants.
    // Confirmed directly: Detroit 2.4% (Treasury Form 5469, TY2023-TY2026),
    // Highland Park 2.0% (HP-1040 booklet), Grand Rapids 1.5% ("July 1, 2010 -
    // Present"), Saginaw 1.50%, Flint 1%, Muskegon 1%.
    // Treasury's roster of the 24 taxing cities matches this list exactly.
    //
    // The other seventeen 1% cities were deliberately NOT sourced one page at a
    // time, and that is not a gap. A city page tells you what it said the day
    // you fetched it; MCL 141.611 and the closed classes above tell you what is
    // possible, which is the stronger guarantee. Those seventeen are capped at
    // 1% by statute -- none of them is over 600,000, none had a pre-Nov-1988
    // rate vote, none sits in 141.503c's population bands, and 141.503b lapsed
    // on its own 13-year limit. A rate above 1% in any of them would need an
    // act of the Legislature first, so re-verifying them city by city buys
    // nothing. Check for a new statutory exception, not for 17 changed pages.
    // (A city may adopt a rate BELOW 1%; none currently does.)
    //
    // NOT MODELLED: Michigan cities allow a personal/dependency exemption, not
    // a standard deduction -- $600 per exemption in Detroit and Highland Park.
    // Nothing here subtracts it, so city tax is charged on gross and is
    // overstated by rate x exemptions: $14.40/yr for a single Detroit filer,
    // $6.00 in a 1% city, ~$57.60 for a Detroit family of four.
