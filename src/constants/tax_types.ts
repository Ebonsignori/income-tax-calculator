/**
 * Real taxes that the person this calculator models does not pay.
 *
 * The calculator knows about one thing: an employee's salary. These are all
 * documented in the tax tables, because they exist and a reader looking up a
 * state should see them, but charging any of them against a paycheck
 * overstates the bill. Two separate reasons land a tax here:
 *
 *  * **The base is not wages.** Washington's capital gains tax applies to
 *    long-term gains above a large standard deduction; New Hampshire's
 *    interest-and-dividends tax (repealed after 2023) applied to that income
 *    alone. Neither state taxes salary at all. Charging them cost a New
 *    Hampshire filer 4% of everything over $2,400 and a Washington filer 7%
 *    of everything over $278,000.
 *  * **The incidence is not the employee.** Newark's payroll tax *is* levied
 *    on wages, so the base is right -- but N.J.S.A. 40:48C-15 puts it on the
 *    employer, the return is filed against a FEIN, and a resident's residency
 *    reduces their employer's bill rather than creating one of their own.
 *    Charging it cost a Newark resident about $1,000 a year at $100,000.
 *
 * So the test for membership is not "is this levied on wages" but "would this
 * come out of the modelled employee's pay". Anything here is excluded from
 * the calculation, from the exemption picker (there is nothing to exempt from
 * a tax that is never charged) and from the bracket ladder.
