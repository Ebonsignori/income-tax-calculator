            What This Calculator Simplifies
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
            Even where the underlying tax data is correct, the model itself
            makes simplifications you should know about:
          </Typography>
          <Box component="ul" sx={{ ml: 3 }}>
            <Typography component="li" variant="body1" paragraph>
              <strong>One income, one earner.</strong> Wage caps such as the
              Social Security wage base, California SDI and the New York and New
              Jersey payroll programs apply per worker, but this calculator
              takes a single income figure. A married couple entering their
              combined household income has those caps applied once rather than
              once per spouse, which understates the total for two-earner
              households.
            </Typography>
            <Typography component="li" variant="body1" paragraph>
              <strong>Deductions, not credits.</strong> Tax is computed from
              brackets applied to income after a standard or custom deduction.
              Credits, exemption phase-outs, dependents, and the many
              state-specific adjustments and add-backs are not modelled.
            </Typography>
            <Typography component="li" variant="body1" paragraph>
              <strong>Whole tax years only.</strong> Rates that change partway
              through a year are carried at whichever rate covered most of it,
              and results assume you lived and worked in the selected place for
              the full year.
            </Typography>
            <Typography component="li" variant="body1" paragraph>
              <strong>Wages, not investments.</strong> Figures describe a
              salary. Taxes levied on investment income, such as Washington
              state capital gains, are documented in the tax tables but are not
              charged against your income here.
