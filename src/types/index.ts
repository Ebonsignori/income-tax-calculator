 * amount falls across it.
 *
 * Bands are half-open, `[min, max)`, and contiguous the same way rate brackets
 * are -- one band's `max` is the next one's `min`. A schedule that publishes
 * "over $19,549 but not over $132,549" is written `min: 19550, max: 132550`.
 *
 * A band needs no reduction at all, which is how a **cliff** is written -- a
 * deduction allowed in full up to a threshold and not at all above it, rather
 * than tapering across a range. Illinois disallows its exemption allowance
 * entirely above $250,000 of base income ("you are not entitled to an
 * exemption allowance on Line 10. Enter 'zero'"), which is:
